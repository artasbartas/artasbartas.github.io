# Artas Bartas

I am a product builder and writer based in Berlin. I spend my working days understanding what makes products tick and businesses succeed. Most recently, I have been working my magic on making customers fall in love with Contentful CMS. I'm a bit of a health nut and I loves to swim, cycle, and run. Find more under @artasbartas.
